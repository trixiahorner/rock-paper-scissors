## Rock Paper Scissors

Inside the `rock_paper_scissors.py` file, you'll find the ASCII art for the hand signals already saved to a corresponding variable: `rock`, `paper`, and `scissors`. This will make it easy to print them out to the console. 

The game by asking the player:

*"What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper or 2 for Scissors."*
